The game code for Bubba Platformer, for the annual BubbaFest 2023.

## What is BubbaFest 2023?

BubbaFest is an annual event held to honor the infamous Bubba series. 
The original BubbaFest was held in 2016, named [BubbaFest2016](https://bubba.fandom.com/wiki/BubbaFest2016 "The BubbaFest2016 Fandom wiki page."). Ever since then, until 2022, BubbaFest has not happend. Recently, among a group of dumbass friends, we have decided to continue BubbaFest continuing from 2022, during which we played the original games, and the few games still available from BubbaFest2016.
___
BubbaFest2023 will now be held internally and perhaps streamed.[^1] More on that in the future.  
The scheduled date is January 6th, 2023 @ 7:00pm EST
